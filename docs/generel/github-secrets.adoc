=== DEPIP

=== DEPKEY

The key for connecting to the host machine.

==== Create such key

connect to the host machine and navigate in the `~/.ssh` directory and execute the following command.

[source, bash]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

Select a name for the key and leave passphrase empty. This will produce a private and public key. Use the following command to attach the public key to the authorized keys.

[source, bash]
----
cat ~/.ssh/<key-name>.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
----

IMPORTANT: Use the public key with the .pub ending not the private key

* `<key-name>`: the name of the key you specified

The remaining unused private key ist the key for the GitHub `DEPKEY` Secrets field.
